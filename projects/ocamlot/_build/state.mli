(**
 * [new_movement ts_index te_index troops sprite side damage speed] 
 * creates a new movement based on given parameters.
 # returns: a new [movement]
 *)
val new_movement : 
  int -> int -> int -> sprite -> allegiance -> float -> float -> movement

val difficulty_level : difficulty ref

(* [possible_moves st team] is an array of [command] instances denoting
   all of the moves that a player with allegiance [team] can make in state [st].
*)
val possible_commands : state -> allegiance -> command array

(* [new_state st c] returns a state representing the
   instantaneous changes that can be made based on
   command [c] and initializes any commands that require
   time.
 *)
val new_state : state -> command -> state

(**
 * [get_scores st] is a tuple containing the player score
      and the enemy score in that order.
   [st] - a valid state
*)
val get_scores : state -> int * int

(*
 * [new_state_plus_delta st c d] is the state that is created by
 * applying command [c] to a state and then waiting [d]
 * seconds. This allows the current movements to progress.
*)
val new_state_plus_delta : state -> command -> float -> state

(**
 * [next_scene sc] checks if the current scene [sc] has ended.
 * A scene is determined to have "ended" based on button clicks in the
 * scene's interface or game logic in its state. If [sc] has ended,
 * the scene's [next] field will be set to the next scene the game must
 * transition to.
 * returns: [scene] with the next optional scene to transition to
 * effects: nothing
 *)
val next_scene : scene -> string option

(**
 * [gameover] is a boolean value that denotes whether the game
      represented by [st] has been completed.
   [st] - the instance of state in question
 *)
val gameover : state -> bool

(* [update sc ipt] takes state [st] from [sc] and creates a [st']
   by ticking animation sprites once. It then creates the
   appropriate command [c] based on input [ipt]. The entire result
   is new_state_plus_delta [st' c d] where [d] is from Renderer.
*)
val update : scene -> input -> state
